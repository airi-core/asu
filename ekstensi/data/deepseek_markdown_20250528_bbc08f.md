## Overview

The ASU Container System represents a paradigm shift in Git repository management, transforming static storage into dynamic, executable ecosystems. This system doesn't just store Git repositoriesâ€”it creates isolated execution environments that allow code to "live" in secure, controlled sandboxes.

## Key Features

- **Git Repository Containerization**: Store Git repositories as executable container entities
- **Secure Sandboxed Execution**: Run code in isolated environments with strict security controls
- **Persistent Metadata Storage**: SQLite database tracks all containers and executions
- **Content Validation**: Validate repository content for safe file extensions
- **Virtual Environment Setup**: Automatic setup of language-specific environments
- **Maintenance Automation**: Scheduled cleanup and optimization tasks
